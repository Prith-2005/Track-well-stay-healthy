    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Eggs are a highly nutritious food, packed with high-quality protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. However, because they contain dietary cholesterol, there has long been debate about whether eating eggs every day is safe. Recent research has provided a more nuanced understanding of their role in a balanced diet.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Value of Eggs</h2>
<p>One large egg contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Approximately 70–80 calories</li>
  <li>6–7 grams of protein</li>
  <li>5 grams of healthy fat</li>
  <li>Choline (important for brain health)</li>
  <li>Vitamin D, B12, and selenium</li>
  <li>Antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin (good for eye health)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cholesterol Concerns</h2>
<p>Egg yolks contain about 186 mg of cholesterol, which led to concerns about their effect on heart health. However, current research shows that for most people:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dietary cholesterol has a limited effect on blood cholesterol levels.</li>
  <li>Saturated and trans fats have a greater impact on raising LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.</li>
  <li>Eggs can actually increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol in many individuals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health Benefits of Eating Eggs Daily</h2>
<p>Eating eggs daily may offer several benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supports muscle growth and repair due to high protein content.</li>
  <li>Promotes eye health and brain function.</li>
  <li>Can aid weight management by promoting satiety and reducing cravings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who Should Be Cautious?</h2>
<p>While eggs are safe for most people, certain individuals may need to moderate intake:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Those with familial hypercholesterolemia or diabetes may need to limit yolk consumption.</li>
  <li>People with existing heart disease should consult their doctor or dietitian.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Healthy Egg Consumption</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Boiled or poached eggs are healthier options compared to fried eggs.</li>
  <li>Pair eggs with vegetables and whole grains for a balanced meal.</li>
  <li>Limit added saturated fats like butter or bacon when eating eggs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For most healthy individuals, eating one egg per day is safe and beneficial. Eggs are a nutrient-dense, affordable, and versatile food that can be part of a heart-healthy diet when eaten in moderation and balanced with other whole foods.</p>
