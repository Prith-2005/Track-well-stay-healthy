    <h2>1. Increases the Risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</h2>
    <p><b>Higher Filtration Load:</b> Excess body fat increases the workload on the kidneys, causing them to filter more blood than normal (a condition called <b>hyperfiltration</b>). Over time, this can damage the kidney's filtering units (nephrons).</p>
    <p><b>Glomerular damage:</b> The increased pressure in glomeruli (tiny filters in kidneys) can lead to <b>glomerulosclerosis</b>â€”scarring of these filters, reducing kidney function.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Promotes Conditions That Harm the Kidneys</h2>
    <p>Obesity is a major risk factor for diseases that directly damage the kidneys, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Type 2 Diabetes:</b> High blood sugar can damage kidney blood vessels and lead to <b>diabetic nephropathy</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):</b> Extra weight increases blood pressure, which can damage kidney vessels and accelerate kidney disease.</li>
      <li><b>Dyslipidemia:</b> Abnormal levels of fats in the blood can contribute to atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries), which reduces kidney perfusion.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Leads to Kidney Stones</h2>
    <p>Obesity changes the acid-base balance and increases <b>uric acid and calcium</b> excretion, both of which increase the risk of kidney stones.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Associated with Obesity-Related Glomerulopathy (ORG)</h2>
    <p>This is a kidney condition <b>specifically linked to obesity</b>, where the kidneys develop enlarged glomeruli and show signs of damage, often leading to <b>proteinuria</b> (protein in the urine) and gradual loss of function.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Complicates Kidney Transplant and Dialysis Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Obesity can make it harder to receive or recover from a <b>kidney transplant</b> and increases the risk of complications in <b>dialysis</b> patients.</p>
    
    <h2>Can Weight Loss Help?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Losing weight through lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce hyperfiltration</li>
      <li>Lower blood pressure and blood sugar</li>
      <li>Improve proteinuria</li>
      <li>Slow down progression of CKD</li>
    </ul>
