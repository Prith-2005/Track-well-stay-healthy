    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Your body burns calories every day just to keep you alive—this is known as your <b>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</b>. BMR is the number of calories your body uses to maintain essential functions like breathing, circulation, cell production, and temperature regulation while at rest.</p>
    
    <h2>What Is Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)?</h2>
    <p><b>BMR</b> accounts for about 60–75% of the total calories you burn daily. It varies depending on factors such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Age:</b> Metabolism slows down with age.</li>
      <li><b>Gender:</b> Males typically have higher BMR due to more muscle mass.</li>
      <li><b>Body Size and Composition:</b> More muscle = higher calorie burn.</li>
      <li><b>Genetics:</b> Your inherited traits can influence metabolism.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)</h2>
    <p>The actual number of calories you burn each day is called your <b>Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)</b>. It includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>BMR</b> – calories burned at rest.</li>
      <li><b>Physical Activity:</b> Exercise and movement throughout the day.</li>
      <li><b>Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):</b> Energy used to digest, absorb, and process food (about 10% of calorie intake).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Estimating Your BMR</h2>
    <p>You can estimate your BMR using formulas like the <b>Harris-Benedict Equation</b>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>For Men:</b> BMR = 88.36 + (13.4 × weight in kg) + (4.8 × height in cm) – (5.7 × age in years)</li>
      <li><b>For Women:</b> BMR = 447.6 + (9.2 × weight in kg) + (3.1 × height in cm) – (4.3 × age in years)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How Many Calories Does the Average Person Burn?</h2>
    <p>The average daily calorie burn (TDEE) for adults is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Women:</b> 1,800 to 2,200 calories per day</li>
      <li><b>Men:</b> 2,200 to 2,800 calories per day</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This varies widely based on activity level. Sedentary individuals burn less, while very active people can burn significantly more.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding how many calories your body naturally burns helps with weight management, fitness goals, and overall health. Calculating your BMR and TDEE is a great first step toward creating a balanced nutrition and exercise plan tailored to your body’s needs.</p>
